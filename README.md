Hello all👋 Myself Fadeela
So basically I am a student with no technical background but still chose Computer Science Engineering 🤷‍♀️
Ironic isn't it?
But I never regretted this choice as I have realized the fact that... I kinda like this journey 😌
I know there is  lot for me to learn and achieve 🤓, therefore this is my first step towards achieveing that 😎.
I just completed the "GitHub Basics" on MuLearn 🥳 and am feeling extremely gratefull 😍
Though i tried watching many youtube tutorials, none of them really gave me an idea of what github is 🥲....
So if anyone asks me "Where to learn about GitHub as an absolute beginner?", I'll definitely recommend MuLearn ❤️‍🔥
Also....
Thank you for taking your lovely time to read this 🫶
